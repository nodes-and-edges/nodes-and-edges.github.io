<h1>Evolution.</h1>
<p class="one_room_p">Back in the day, we had self-preservation—a set of behaviors that ensured the survival of an organism.
<br>
It made life interesting. We had to be very creative to get food, being one of the weakest creatures in the world.
<br>
This led us to build tools. Tools that kept us safe. Tools that made us reluctant to leave our comfort zone.

<h1>Perfectly imperfect.</h1>
<p class="one_room_p">I had to think of you. Do you remember? 'Perfect is boring, and you need random moments'? Yesterday on the metro, there was a guy filling a balloon with helium from a bottle and then inhaling it. And another guy on the bus peed all over the place—it smelled so bad.
<br>
The story makes sense why you thought of me. It all started with your story in Singapore. But maybe you’d rather tell it yourself.
<br>
Okay. Alright. So, I told the guys about Singapore, but something was missing. I didn’t know what. And then I watched videos of people throwing up in the subway, and it just felt... I don’t know, alive? Unexpected things—they were missing there. And then, a week later... you tell the rest.
<br> 
It was the morning after. I was walking my dog and was about to pick up his poop—not looking forward to it. Then a taxi pulled up, stopped, and a guy threw up all over the place. The whole car was a mess. I couldn’t stop laughing.

<h1>Regretting.</h1>
<p class="one_room_p">I was asking myself. What can I do with my life without regretting it when I am 80?<br>
And my answer is simple.<br>
Dedicating my life to something I am interested in—something that has a positive impact. It doesn't have to be the biggest or greatest thing with a lot of admiration from the crowd. Just something to satisfy me.</p>

<h1>Pointless Life <i>by Christina</i></h1>
<p class="one_room_p">Some time ago, I started asking people a very simple question. 
<br>
"Imagine you have an empty room. You are allowed to do an exhibition on a topic of your choice. What would the topic be?"
<br>
I loved the answers. I saw people's personalities in them—how they answered, how long they took, the questions they asked before answering, and the ideas they shared. It all made sense. And it gave each person the space to express their inner thoughts and share what is important to them.
<br>
And here we are, about a year after the first question was asked out loud—having our own little space to share a small part of ourselves with the world.
