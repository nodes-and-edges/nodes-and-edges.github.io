I found a super fascinating paper on knowledge graphs for eyes, messaged the author, got disencouraged, cried to my boyfriend, stopped crying, found some cool NLP tutorials and now here we are! Building a knowledge graph from text. Whether it will be useful or not will be seen in the future, but I really enjoyed generating the knowledge graph.

# Coding [Methods]

* Text preprocessing: Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
* Named entity recognition: BERN2, PubTator 3.0 with AIONER
* Relation extractor: zero-shot relation extractor (zero_shot_re)

## Working more or less ... [Results]

I will show some pretty pictures here soon

## Takeaway message [Lessons learned, Discussion, Conclusion]

* If you want to do something, just start (and finish it)!
