# I failed an anatomy exam and build a JavaScript app

## A little story about eyeQ [Introduction]

I failed an exam in anatomy, and needed to study. Which lead to a lot of ideas, because what time is better to start a random new project than in times where your goal is to memorise what the difference between cranial nerve 2 and 3 is. So, I ended up creating a little JavaScript quiz.

## Mood board and inspiration [Planning]

I used Notion. I just copied a couple of pictures from the internet and very fast I decided a quiz that doesn't test me, but rather teach me, is the way to go. Just like Duolingo does!

## Coding [Methods]

I used a tutorial on CodePen: PATTERNS https://codepen.io/Pedro-Ondiviela/pen/jORgbbK. I used this before and am quite please with the code quality of this person!

You can see my code once it is done here.

## Graphics [Methods]

I used Photoshop 2024 and Illustrator 2020.

## Questions [Methods]

I used publications to get information about the anatomy of the posterior segment.

## It is done!! [Results]

You can test it here: [eyeQ](../hatched/eyeq.md)

## Takeaway message [Lessons learned, Discussion, Conclusion]

Make sure to check code whether it is useful or not. I tried to make ChatGPT write code for me, it didn't work. Then I tried to change multiple codes from the internet, which made me very frustrated. Finally, I remembered, that I used that PATTERNS tutorial before and was happy with the code, so I ended up using that as a base.
