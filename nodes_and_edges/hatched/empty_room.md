<h1>Evolution.</h1>
<p class="one_room_p">Back in the days, we had self-preservation, a set of behaviors that ensures the survival of an organism.
<br>
It made life interesting. We needed to be very creative about getting food, being one of the weakest creatures in the world.
<br>
This made us build tools. Tools that keep us safe. Tools that make us not want to leave our comfort zone.

<h1>Perfectly imperfect.</h1>
<p class="one_room_p">I had to think of you. Do you remember? 'Perfect is boring, and you need random moments'? Yesterday on the metro, there was a guy filling a balloon with helium from a bottle and then inhaling it. And another guy on the bus peed all over the place—it smelled so bad.
<br>
The story makes sense why you thought of me. It all started with your story in Singapore. But maybe you’d rather tell it yourself.
<br>
Okay. Alright. So, I told the guys about Singapore, something was missing. I didn’t know what. And then I watched videos of people throwing up in the subway, and it just felt ... I don't know, alive? Unexpected things. They were missing there. And then, a week later ... you tell the rest.
<br> 
It was the morning after. I was walking my dog and was about to pick up his poop—not looking forward to it. Then a taxi pulled up, stopped, and a guy threw up all over the place. The whole car was a mess. I couldn’t stop laughing.

<h1>Regretting.</h1>
<p class="one_room_p">I was asking myself. What I can do with my life without regretting it when I am 80?<br>
And my answer is simple.<br>
Dedicating my life to something I am interested in. Into something that has a postivie impact. It doesn't have to be the biggest or greatest thing with a lot of admirance from the crowed. Just something to satisfy me.

<h1>Pointless Life <i>by Christina</i></h1>
<p class="one_room_p">Some time ago I started asking people a very simple question. 
<br>
"Imagine you have an empty room. You are allowed to do do an exhibition with a topic of your choice. What would the topic be?"
<br>
I loved the answers. I saw people's personalities in their answers. How they answered, how long they took to answer, what questions they asked before answering and what their ideas were. It all made sense and gave every single person the space to express their inner thoughts and share what is important to them.
<br>
And here we are. About one year after the first question was asked out loud. Having our own little space for sharing a little part of us to the world.
